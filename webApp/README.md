In recent years, researchers in academia have begun to generate an increasing amount of data in the course of their experimetns and observations. This data is of interest to other researchers for analysis, verification, and for building their effort on prior work in the field. Legislation also requires Universities to comply with rules that dictate retaining data for a number of years after a publication has appeared in a journal. 

DBLP is a computer science bibliography website hosted at Universit√§t Trier, in Germany. DBLP listed more than 3.4 million journal articles, conference papers, and other publications on computer science in July 2016.
